Pythonic way to solve the Girl Friend Problem. Yes this bot would random sms from the heap to your Girl Friend, every specified interval of time. It helped me a lot! :P. It is hosted in http://pythonanywhere.com, a free hosting site for python.

You can make your caring mom believe, that you ate. (Daily cron at 9 pm is doing that for me!)

I have ideas to extend it to birthdays as well. A cron that would send sms to your friends on their b'day.
